<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dhruv Limbani</h1>

Hello! I'm Dhruv, a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing an MS in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, where I developed a strong interest in building software solutions to real-world problems using Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Data Engineering.

My experience spans working with tabular, visual, and textual data across industries like finance, healthcare, and academia. I have built data-driven solutions involving exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, neural networks, API development, and web applications. I am proficient in Python, C, C++, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, with hands-on experience in data engineering tools like Apache Airflow, PowerBI, and MS Excel. Additionally, I work with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and NLTK for AI-driven applications, and I develop web-based solutions using FastAPI, Streamlit, and Git.

I am always eager to explore new advancements in AI and collaborate on research or projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with data. Feel free to connect if you're interested in working together or discussing opportunities for Summer 2025!
