<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dhruv Limbani</h1>

Hello! I'm Dhruv, a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing MS in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning.
I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, where I developed a passion for solving real-world problems using Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

All of my current and previous projects, as well as the research work I conducted during my bachelor's, incorporate:
1) Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, and Pre-processing (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2) Machine Learning algorithms (Scikit-learn)
3) Dense, Convolutional, and Recurrent Neural Networks (TensorFlow, Keras)
4) Generative Adversarial Networks (TensorFlow, Keras)
5) Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation (Scikit-learn)
6) Building API endpoints (FastAPI)
7) Developing Web apps (Streamlit)

Throughout my journey in machine learning, I have worked with tabular, visual, and textual data, some of which relate to the academic, finance, and healthcare industries.

I would love to explore more state-of-the-art (SOTA) advancements in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing, and I am looking forward to conducting research and working with other different forms of data, such as audio, to broaden my familiarity with various algorithms, architectures, and data types.

You can reach out to me at djl2204@columbia.edu if you have any internship opportunities for Summer 2025 that align with my current work, or if you are looking for someone to collaborate on a project or research work.
